# ðŸŽ¶ How to Extract Spectrograms from Audio with Python

This repository demonstrates how to extract **Spectrograms** from audio files using Python.  
Spectrograms are visual representations of the **frequency content** of a signal over time and are widely used in **speech analysis, music processing, and audio signal research**.
